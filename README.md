## connectivity_plus package :-

The connectivity_plus package in Flutter is a plugin that provides functionality to detect the type of network connection (WiFi, cellular data, etc.) currently available on the device.

Purpose :
   * Helps your Flutter app understand the network environment (WiFi, mobile data, or no connection).
   * Enables you to adapt your app's behavior based on the available network type.

Benefits :
   * Improved User Experience: You can display informative messages, disable features, or adjust content based on network availability (e.g., display cached content offline).
   * Simplified Development: Provides a platform-agnostic way to check network connectivity, saving you from writing separate code for Android and iOS.
